# List of Modern Data Tools
## What is "the modern data stack", actually?
Thats a tough one!  You can't really say that there is such a thing as the one and only modern data stack.However, there are certain ideas/tools/do's and dont's/etc. that can be combined to form one thing that is modern and is a data stack. These tools tend to be easy-to-use, open, cloud-native or even SaaS. Go Data Driven has a [blog article](https://godatadriven.com/blog/modern-data-stack-the-road-to-democratizing-data/) that describes this pretty well. Are you asking yourself now, "So that's it, I'll just switch all my tools to the ones listed here and then I've got it?" - Far from it! As always, it's all about the people ...

## WORK IN PROGRESS:
Next things to add
- more tools
- maybe best practices / reference architecutres?
